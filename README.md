# Some Family Recipes

Well, it happened again. Things got a bit crazy during the holiday preparations, and the dog knocked over the pile of punched cards Grandma uses for her recipe database. "That's no way for someone to live," we exclaimed, and offered to bring them to a bit more up-to-date format. We got it mostly right, though some of the bits might be jumbled up.

So, if you want access to the recipe database, all you need to do is a simple `npm serve`. Or you can enjoy the silliness directly at https://www.caseyc.net/xmas/2018 or http://www.molly.is/xmas/2018

Enjoy!
